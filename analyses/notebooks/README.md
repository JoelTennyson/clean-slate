# Notebooks

Does your fantastic analysis not really _need_ much? Is it contained inside a single file, and doesn't generate any outputs? Is it well documented internally, and not need a separate documentation file?

This is a good home for that code, then! Make sure your code is actually well documented, add it to this folder, and then update this readme with a quick blurb about what it does! List items should follow this format:

```
* [Name of notebook](filename) _description of what your code does_
```
