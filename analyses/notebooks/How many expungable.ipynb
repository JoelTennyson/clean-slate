    "# Clean Slate: Estimating offenses eligible for expungement under varying conditions\n",
    "> Prepared by [Laura Feeney](https://github.com/laurafeeney) for Code for Boston's [Clean Slate project](https://github.com/codeforboston/clean-slate).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to get a list of all charges from both Northwestern and Suffolk data, then map expungement eligibility to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting datasets will be output as a separate .csv that can be save and shared in the Clean Slate GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to join prosecution charges with expungability, and estimate the number of offenses which are eligible for expungement. This analysis will be run a number of times: under existing regulation, and under varying conditions allowing additional offenses to be expunged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target questions, provided June 28, 2020: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many people (under age 21) are eligible for expungement today? This would be people with only **one charge** that is not part of the list of ineligible offenses (per section 100J). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on only having **one incident** (which could include multiple charges) that are not part of the list of ineligible offenses?\n",
    " - How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on only having **one incident** if only sex-based offenses or murder were excluded from expungement?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on who has **not been found guilty** (given current offenses that are eligible for expungement)?\n",
    " - How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on who has **not been found guilty** for all offenses except for murder or sex-based offenses?\n",
