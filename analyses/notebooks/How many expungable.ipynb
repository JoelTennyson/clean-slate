    "This notebook takes somewhat processed data from the Northwestern DA and answers the following questions, posed June 28, 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will be run a number of times: under existing regulation, and under varying conditions allowing additional offenses to be expunged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many people (under age 21) are eligible for expungement today? This would be people with only **one charge** that is not part of the list of ineligible offenses (per section 100J). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on only having **one incident** (which could include multiple charges) that are not part of the list of ineligible offenses?\n",
    " - How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on only having **one incident** if only sex-based offenses or murder were excluded from expungement?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on who has **not been found guilty** (given current offenses that are eligible for expungement)?\n",
    " - How many people (under age 21) would be eligible based on who has **not been found guilty** for all offenses except for murder or sex-based offenses?\n",
