# Analyses

Did you do something with the data? Develop sicknasty graphs that will knock legislators off their heels? Build models that will change juvenile criminal justice in Massachusetts from now till forever? 

This is where that lives! All the code of your analyses and outputs should exist nested in here. If your code spans multiple files, creates outputs, or is just super impressive, feel free to make a subfolder in this directory and add it to the list below! Please, please, _please_ include a readme in your folder explaining what your code does! Otherwise, feel free to throw self-contained analysis units in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder and document them there. 

Current folders in here include:

* [Notebooks](notebooks) holds all single file projects that don't need their own folder
* [Data expungement](data-expungement) contains the initial analysis that we used to determine PA was the best proxy for MA crime, using 2014 FBI data.
