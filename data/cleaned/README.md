# Cleaned datasets (and scripts to do the cleaning)

This folder contains datasets that have been cleaned of errors and challenges and are ready to be processed into a format usable for final analyses, as well as the scripts used to convert raw data (stored in the raw folder) into the cleaned version. 

Please document your code (with comments mentioning what sort of errors are being cleaned and why you're cleaning them) and add your dataset to this readme with a quick blurb listing its source (raw dataset or original source location), extent (temporal/other windowing factors, size of the dataset, and if it's a sample, how large of a sample it is and how samples were chosen), any non-obvious variables (to newcomers to the dataset), and uses so far!
