# Raw datasets (and scripts to retrieve them as applicable)

This folder contains all non-sensitive raw datasets obtained for this project. 

When adding data, please add your dataset to this readme with a quick blurb listing:
- its source (original source location and retrieval method)
- extent (temporal/other windowing factors, size of the dataset, and if it's a sample, how large of a sample it is and how samples were chosen)
- any non-obvious variables (to newcomers to the dataset)
- and uses so far!
