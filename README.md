# Clean Slate

_Changing the system and changing lives._

## Terms to Know

**Expungement:** "Having a criminal record expunged means that the record will be permanently destroyed so that it's no longer accessible by the court or any other state, municipal, or county agencies." ([source](https://www.mass.gov/expunge-your-criminal-record))
**Sealing:** "Sealing your criminal record does not get rid of it, but fewer people can see it. After the records are sealed, most employers, landlords and others will not be able to see the records when they do a CORI check. When you apply for a job after your records are sealed, you can say 'I have no record.'" ([source](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/cori/sealing))


## What’s Wrong

Each year, thousands of Massachusetts children and teenagers become involved with the criminal justice system. In Massachusetts, children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be arrested, charged in court, removed from their homes, and confined in secure, locked facilities. Once released, they may not be able to secure employment or housing due to their criminal records -- even if they were never convicted in the first place.

People may be able to clear their records under MA G.L. c.276, § 100E-100U, a 239-part law passed in 2018 allowing sealing or expungement of certain criminal records that occurred before a person's 21st birthday. But the law is extremely complicated, with hundreds of criteria that may disqualify an individual. As such, very few people have been able to improve their prospects through the law.

[Citizens For Juvenile Justice](https://www.cfjj.org/) is working with [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) (a civic tech volunteer organization) and legal aid services in the Boston area to tackle this problem on a project called Clean Slate.

## What We're Doing About It

### Data Work: Change the system.

We're looking to help provide advocates with information to share with legislators, policymakers, and other community members. We are gathering and using data to identify how many people are currently eligible to have their records sealed or expunged, and how changes to the law would impact eligibility across Massachusetts.

For more on the data branch of our project, check out [our data documentation](https://github.com/codeforboston/clean-slate/wiki/Data-Work).

### App Work: Change people's lives.

We're also working on developing applications to help people navigate the extremely complicated process of sealing or expunging (which are two different things) their records, helping make the 45,000-word law more understandable to those needing to navigate it.

For more information on the application side of things, see [how to get started](https://github.com/codeforboston/clean-slate/wiki/App-Team). 

## Who We Need

We need members of the community, legal professionals, community advocates, project managers, designers, technologists, and people passionate about criminal justice reform to help us understand what’s wrong with what we have and to try to make it better. Some of the roles we're trying to fill include:

* Project managers, interested in helping organizing our work and keeping us moving forward
* User experience designers, especially if you're interested in helping design form content to explain this complicated law to our users
* App programmers who want to learn a cool domain-specific language ([Docassemble](https://docassemble.org/)) for guiding users through the expungement process (or want to work with [Aloe](https://aloe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to help us write tests!)
* Data scientists and data analysts, looking to help with identifying, obtaining, cleaning, and analysing data sets (we're language-agnostic)


## Get Involved

- Join the [Code for Boston slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cfb-public/code-for-boston) and talk to us on the #clean-slate channel, as well as the #clean-slate-app and #clean-slate-data branch channels.
- Contact us by [filling out our interest form](https://forms.gle/FZrBfNjC6JNtsQXP7).
- Look at what we’ve done so far - we’re collecting what we learn in shared folders and some separate repositories.
  - Our [shared folders](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EiEt97817QzZNip9X5yrsXAdPCqUdF0M?usp=sharing).
  - This repo's [wiki](https://github.com/codeforboston/clean-slate/wiki), which contains notes on the policy impact data analysis efforts.
  - An online [juvenile sealing app](https://github.com/knod/docassemble-juvenilesealing) that's currently under development.

## Our Goals

1. Make it easier for folks to apply for expungement.
1. Show what parts of the law are stopping most people from expunging their records.
1. Digitally organize to advocate for changes to the law.
